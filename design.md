## Typography
- **Display Font**: Fran (slab serif, regular 400 + bold 700) — self-hosted from `assets/fonts/`, used for h1/h2 only
- **Body Font**: Rawson (humanist sans, regular 400 + italic + bold 700 + bold italic) — self-hosted from `assets/fonts/`, used for everything else

Fran is a contemporary slab serif providing warm, confident headings reserved exclusively for h1/h2 elements. Rawson handles everything else — body text, labels, buttons, smaller headers (h3–h6), navigation — with clean humanist letterforms that balance professionalism with approachability. Display headings (h1/h2) use Fran Bold 700 at -0.01em letter-spacing. Smaller headers and labels use Rawson weight 600–700. Body text defaults to Rawson 14–16px weight 400 with 1.4–1.6 line-height for clear readability. Button text uses Rawson weight 600 at 16px. The type system uses the slab sparingly for maximum impact on primary headings.

Fonts are self-hosted (no third-party font CDN) to maintain brand control and privacy. Files are bundled by Vite into `_nuxt/` with hashed names so they cannot be casually downloaded by URL guessing.

Type scale: 12px (micro/caption) / 14px (body) / 16px (subtitle) / 20px (section title) / 24px (page title) / 32px (hero heading)

## Elevation
Elevation is subtle and warm, avoiding harsh shadows. Standard cards use `box-shadow: 0 0 0 1px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.08), 0 2px 4px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.06)` combining a thin border-like shadow with a soft drop. Hover cards elevate to `box-shadow: 0 0 0 1px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.08), 0 4px 12px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.12)`. Modals use `box-shadow: 0 4px 16px rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.2)` with a background scrim at rgba(0, 0, 0, 0.6). The warm background color (#F4F2EE) makes white cards naturally feel elevated without heavy shadows.

## Do's and Don'ts
- Do use the warm linen background (#F4F2EE) consistently — it defines the brand's warmth
- Do keep card layouts structured with clear visual hierarchy using weight contrast
- Don't use bright or playful colors; maintain corporate trust through the navy palette
- Do show professional context (job title, company) alongside every user mention
- Don't over-use the gold/premium color; reserve it exclusively for paid tier indicators
- Do maintain generous line-height (1.4+) for body text to aid scanning dense content
- Don't use rounded avatars for companies — square with 4px radius for orgs, round for people
- Do provide clear visual feedback for connection states (pending, connected, following)
